# ATARI_2DOF_drawing_bot_hardware

GO HERE FOR SOFTWARE: [ATARI_2DOF_Drawing_Bot](https://github.com/Atarilab/ATARI_2DOF_Drawing_Bot)

This repository contains all the necessary information and files to build a ATARI 2DOF drawing robot.
The goal of this build is to have a system solely consisting of off the shelf parts and 3D printed parts while keeping costs down.

## Off the shelf parts

The parts listed here can be purchased from multiple online stores and retailers. If the linked stores provided in this documentation don't have the necessary parts in stock or don't deliver to your country, it shouldn't be a problem to order from a different retailer. In case you are not using the provided links for purchasing the parts, make sure that all specs and dimensions of the components match the ones listed here.

### Cables

Ideally the cables for this build are crimped to guarantee good contacts and durability. Alternatively, the cables can also be soldered if being done with caution.
Use this dupont crimp tool or a similar crimp tool with the corresponding dupont crimps so your cables will be compatbile with the rest of th electronics.
